A Recipe for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus.

The WSJ corpus consists of about 80 hours of read sentences taken from the Wall
Street Journal. The WSJ corpus can be purchased from the LDC as LDC93S6B (wsj0)
and LDC94S13B (wsj1).

In these experiments we use three subsets following the Kaldi WSJ recipe:

- train: 37318 utterances, referred to as train_si284 in Kaldi
- dev: 503 utterances, referred to as dev92 in Kaldi
- test: 333 utterances, referred to as eval93 in Kaldi
